# IOWA SEQIC REPORT PREP 2024 ----------------------------------------------
# This script prepares for the analyses using the `traumar` package v1.2.0
# For the shapefiles, it is assumed that the files are downloaded from
# https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php using the year 2024
# and then utilizing the Counties (and equivalent), States (and equivalent), and
# Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAS) options in the dropdown dialogue to download
# the files manually and put them in the directory used here.

## PACKAGES -------------------------------------------------------------------

## CRAN versions ================================================================

# CALCULATION FACILITIES =====================================================

# Apply rm_bin_summary with dynamic parameters based on sample size
#
# This function:
# - Accepts a dataset with propensity scores and binary outcomes.
# - Checks for insufficient data (n < 2) and returns a 1-row tibble with
#   pre-defined structure filled with NA_real_ values.
# - Otherwise, determines the number of observations in the dataset and
#   sets thresholds and divisors dynamically:
#     - ≤100 rows: thresholds (0.8, 0.9), divisors = 1
#     - 101–200 rows: thresholds (0.9, 0.99), divisors = 1
#     - >200 rows: thresholds (0.9, 0.99), divisors = 3
# - Applies `traumar::rm_bin_summary()` with the appropriate parameters,
#   using `{{ }}` to support unquoted column names.
# - Returns a tibble summarizing binary outcome performance across propensity bins,
#   with optional bootstrap-based confidence intervals.
#
# Used to flexibly summarize performance metrics across variable sample sizes,
# including edge-case handling for very small cohorts.

# DATA MANIPULATION FACILITIES ===============================================

###_____________________________________________________________________________
# Standard output from traumar is in wide format, with separate columns for each
# SEQIC indicator's numerator, denominator, and calculated value (seqic_*).
#
# The following metadata and helper functions facilitate transforming that wide
# output into a long, tidy format that is easier to analyze, visualize, and
# interpret.
#
# Recommended workflow:
# 1. Compute indicators using traumar::seqic_indicator_*() functions.
# 2. Pass the resulting wide-format data to reshape_seqic_indicators()
#    to pivot it into long format with separate rows per indicator.
# 3. Use match_seqic_indicator() to append indicator names and goals
#    by matching on the indicator code.
# 4. Compute comparison service area and trauma facility verification level
# results
# 5. Use format_seqic_comparison() to clean up service area and comparable trauma
# facility verification results
# 6. Join the service area and comparable verified trauma center data to the
# agency-level data to provide a type of benchmark

# upper_ci) and the indicator code (e.g., "8", "8_all") into separate
# components.
# - Uses `.value` in `names_to` to spread the value types into columns.
# - Renames `seqic` to `performance` and standardizes `lower_ci` and `upper_ci` to
# `lower ci` and `upper ci` for readability.
#
# Optional renaming parameters (`rename_cols`, `column_pattern`,
# `match_pattern`, `replace_with`) allow users to dynamically standardize

# --- format_seqic_comparison ---
# Generalized function to format SEQIC indicator results for use as
# comparison benchmarks (region or trauma facility level).
#
# Arguments:
# - data: A tibble of wide-format SEQIC indicator results.
# - type: A string specifying the benchmark type, either "region" or "level".
#
# Output:
# A long-format tibble with indicator metadata and a single column renamed to
# reflect the comparison type:
# - "comparison region performance" or
# - "comparison trauma facility performance"
#
# Usage in workflow:
# 1. Calculate comparison data grouped by region or trauma level.
# 2. Use this function to prepare those data for joining with agency-level outputs.

# Join comparison benchmarks to SEQIC results and format for reporting
#
# This function merges SEQIC performance results with comparison benchmarks
# at both the state level (`data_level`) and the regional level (`data_region`).
#
# It performs the following operations:
# - Joins `data` to `data_level` by Year, Level I/II designation, and indicator code.
# - Joins `data` to `data_region` by Year, Service Area, and indicator code.
# - Applies `pretty_percent()` formatting from the traumar package to all relevant
#   percentage-based columns, rounding to 2 decimal places and preserving `NA` values.
# - Standardizes all column names to lowercase.
# - Renames `level_i_ii` to `level` for consistency in output.
#
# Expected inputs:
# - `data`: Long-format SEQIC results with columns like Year, Level_I_II, Service Area, and indicator.
# - `data_level`: State-level comparison data, matched on Year, Level_I_II, and indicator.
# - `data_region`: Region-level comparison data, matched on Year, Service Area, and indicator.
#
# Returns a formatted tibble with performance values and comparisons ready for tabular report output.

# export_state_data
# Export State Data to CSV
#
# This function exports a given data frame or tibble to a CSV file. The file is saved in a dynamically generated
# directory based on the provided root directory and subfolder name. The file name is constructed using the name
# of the input data frame or tibble.
#
# Parameters:
# - x: A data frame or tibble containing the data to be exported.
#
# - output_dir_root: A string specifying the root directory where the output file will be saved. Defaults to the
#   value of the "STATE_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH" environment variable.
#
# - subfolder: A string specifying the subfolder name to be used in the output file path.
#
# Side Effects:
# - Creates the output directory if it does not already exist.
#
# - Writes the data frame or tibble to a CSV file in the specified directory.
#
# Output:
# - Returns `invisible(NULL)`; the primary function is the side-effect of file export.
#
# Workflow Context:
# - Use this function to export state-level data to CSV files for further analysis or reporting.
